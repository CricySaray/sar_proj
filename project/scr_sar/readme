This filelist in dir is my scripts from daily collections.
Below are three type file adapted to all code languages:
 - *.common.* : not for specified software, you can source it in csh/bash
 - *.invs.*		: only for innovus shell
 - *.invsGUI.*: only for innovus GUI view, you can run it in invs shell, but effort can view in GUI
 - *.pt.*			: only for PrimeTime shell

# Some of the scripts here are intended for **reserving slots in advance** - this is to prevent forgetting what types of scripts to write later. 
# These scripts do not contain the core code; instead, only the `description` section is completed, which specifies what kind of script needs to 
# be written. You can use the command `rg TO_WRITE` to search for them and get the names of these scripts that require completion of the main code section.
