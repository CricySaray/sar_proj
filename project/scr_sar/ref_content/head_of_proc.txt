# tcl proc:
#   -> atomic_proc : Specially used for calling and information transmission of other procs, 
#                    providing a variety of error prompt codes for easy debugging
#   -> display_proc : Specifically used for convenient access to information in the innovus command line, 
#                    focusing on data display and aesthetics
#   -> gui_proc   : for gui display, or effort can be viewed in invs GUI
#   -> task_proc  : composed of multiple atomic_proc , focus on logical integrity, 
#                   process control, error recovery, and the output of files and reports when solving problems.
#   -> dump_proc  : dump data with specific format from db(invs/pt/starrc/pv...)
#   -> check_proc : only for checking for some stage(FP/place/cts/route/finish...)
#   -> math_proc  : manages mathematical computations and geometric logic—including coordinate/shape operations—optimized 
#                   for large datasets and graphics-related numerical tasks.
#   -> package_proc : The "package_proc" procedures implement functionalities similar to those in packages, 
#                     while incorporating custom minor features.
#   -> test_proc  : only for testing specified function or process
#   -> datatype_proc : includes procs for defining, building, and managing custom data structures with core 
#                     operations like storage, mapping, and basic manipulation.
#   -> db_proc    : some action proc about database process
#   -> flow_proc  : Functions specifically designed for building flow processes.
#   -> report_proc : gen report file of information
#   -> misc_proc  : some other uses of procs
# perl sub:
#   -> format_sub : processes data and outputs it in specific formats
