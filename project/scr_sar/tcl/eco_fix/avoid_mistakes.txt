# The Mistake I Encountered
 - When working on ECO, if you want to ecoDeleteRepeater buffers or inverters and also want to delete the net, you need 
    to follow the order of first using editDelete -net, then ecoDeleteRepeater. If you delete the repeater first, some 
    nets will no longer exist. When you then use editDelete -net to delete the nets that previously existed, it will 
    cause the invs tool to be unable to reroute during subsequent ecoRoute. Therefore, you must follow the sequence of 
    first using editDelete -net, then ecoDeleteRepeater to remove the corresponding buffers or inverters.
    - Detail scenario:
      After using ecoDeleteRepeater to delete the inst, if you immediately use editDelete -net to delete one of the nets 
      that existed before the inst was deleted, the invs tool will not report an **ERROR. Therefore, this is a hidden 
      error that is not easy to detect.
      Once, I couldn't complete routing via ecoRoute. During LVS (Layout Versus Schematic) checks, I found this net was open. 
      I sought help from several people but got no solution. In the end, I had to manually draw this net, which was extremely 
      troublesome. So, such incorrect operations must never happen again. If you encounter a net where one buffer drives 
      multiple sinks, the method of manually drawing the net will be really torturous and a huge waste of time.
