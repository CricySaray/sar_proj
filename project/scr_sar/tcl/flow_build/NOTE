genCmd_* files: not to change invs/pt db
runCmd_* files: will change invs/pt db
genFile_* files: not to change invs/pt db, generate several file

# When building a flow, mutually exclusive logic must be applied. Specifically, when two versions of data from ECO9 need 
# to run in parallel, both versions will call ECO9 data simultaneously. Moreover, they will modify the same STARRC or PT 
# file at the same time—which may lead to mutual errors in data reading. This results in an undefined state. Therefore, 
# when writing the flow, special attention must be paid to scenarios where different versions run in parallel.
