PR:
  check FP
  check if it has errors on logv(using perl script)
  check if all dump data are complete(gds/def/netlist)
  
  - principles:
    need not to change flow logic code, which can be modified by config file or setup file
    use procs to run or generate other cmds as much as possible, which need you write better procs body
  - tip:
    handle on special situation. e.g. testing only one stage flow, you'd better add some suffix for version number in order to diff them
    !!! can configurate to control flow from one stage to another stage, like: from cts to chipfinish, default from init to chipfinish
    !!! control special different name of invs db saved by hand yourself, that is not generated by flow.
PT:
